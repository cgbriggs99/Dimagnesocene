	abstract = {The complex diberyllocene, {CpBeBeCp} (Cp, cyclopentadienyl anion), has been the subject of numerous chemical investigations over the past five decades yet has eluded experimental characterization. We report the preparation and isolation of the compound by the reduction of beryllocene ({BeCp}2) with a dimeric magnesium(I) complex and determination of its structure in the solid state by means of x-ray crystallography. Diberyllocene acts as a reductant in reactions that form beryllium-aluminum and beryllium-zinc bonds. Quantum chemical calculations indicate parallels between the electronic structure of diberyllocene and the simple homodiatomic species diberyllium (Be2).},

	abstract = {The chemistry of the group 2 metals (beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium) is dominated by the +2 oxidation state. Here, we report the reductions of two magnesium({II}) iodide complexes with potassium metal in toluene, leading to thermally stable magnesium(I) compounds, (L){MgMg}(L) (where L is [(Ar){NC}({NPri}2)N(Ar)]– or \{[(Ar){NC}(Me)]2CH\}–, Ar is 2,6-diisopropylphenyl, Me is methyl, and Pri is isopropyl) in moderate yields. The results of x-ray crystallographic and theoretical studies are consistent with central Mg 2+2 units that have single, covalent magnesium-magnesium bonding interactions with 2.8508 ± 0.0012 (standard deviation) and 2.8457 ± 0.0008 angstrom bond lengths, respectively, and predominantly ionic interactions with the anionic ligands (L).},

	abstract = {Resa, Carmona, Gutierrez-Puebla, and Monge recently reported the synthesis and characterization of a remarkable sandwiched di-zinc compound, Me5C5ZnZnC5Me5. Although Resa et al. emphasize that this is the first Zn(I) compound with a Zn–Zn bond, we find the {CpMMCp} sandwich metal dimer bonding motif to be even more fascinating. The present theoretical studies of {CpBeBeCp}, {CpMgMgCp}, and {CpCaCaCp} demonstrate that the structural pattern discovered for zinc is more generally applicable. The predicted Be–Be distance of 2.06 Å, Mg–Mg distance of 2.77 Å, and Ca–Ca distance of 3.74 Å are indicative of substantial Be–Be, Mg–Mg, and Ca–Ca bonding. The {NBO} analysis shows that each metal atom has one covalent bond (to the other metal atom) and a predominantly ionic linkage to the adjacent cyclopentadienyl ring.},
